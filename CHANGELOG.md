# Changelog

## Unreleased (pre-alpha)

Initial implementation. See `docs/development/status.md` for what is
implemented, experimental and planned.

* Optional Serena v1.7.0 (MIT, pinned) integration for LSP-backed symbol
  navigation per task worktree: `repointel.Navigator`, process manager,
  context-planner routing (graph for breadth, Serena for depth), `serena
  setup|status`, `intel symbol|refs|impls`, doctor checks, `bench intel`
  overlap study, `--serena on|off`, CI pin guard (ADR-0008).
* Benchmark harness: Go module-cache sources for large repositories,
  per-task repository-intelligence metrics; the hidden-check self-test now
  uses the bench PID limit (it previously passed Go tasks for the wrong
  reason).
